# YAES
YAES - Yet Another Email Script is a simple PHP/Javascript script I personally used for sending emails on some websites. Nothing fancy, gets the job done in a pinch.


Provided frontend uses no libraries, only vanilla Javascript.
- HTML5 validation and a small javascript check for empty values
- Ajax call


# Dependencies
* PHP 5 and above
* Modern Browsers only, no compatibility for old browsers intentionally built in

#Configure
- Change to, from, and subject variables in email.php to suit your needs
- Drop in your PHP/mail enabled enviornment
- Enjoy

#Usage
You may make any change, no attribution needed. All I ask is if you find a bug to report it.

#Note
I understand MooTools and jQuery can drastically simplify things, but this project was about keeping dependencies low for quick convenient use
